# TicTacToe

This is a small tic-tac-toe app written in Swift and SwiftUI using the MVVM
architecture. I will **probably** update the app to make the computer player
actually play some sensible moves with the Minimax algorithm.

### Devices
This app is not built for iPads and smaller iPhones and I recommend you test it out 
on an iPhone 8 Plus (and above) simulator for the best experience.
